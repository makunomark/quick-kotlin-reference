## 8.1.1 Calling functions passed as arguments

```kotlin
fun twoAndThree(operation: (Int, Int) -> Int){
    val result = operation(2,3)
    println("The result is $result")
}

>>> twoAndThree{ a, b -> a + b }
The result is 5
>>> twoAndThree{ a, b -> a * b }
The result is 6
```

The syntax of calling the function passed as an argument is the same as calling a regular function.

**Scenario: Reimplementing `filter` function on `String`.**

> This is only for simplicity. The generic function that works on a collection of any elements works in the same way.

- The declaration:

```kotlin
fun String.filter(predicate: (Char) -> Boolean): String
```

- `filter` takes a predicate funtion that takes a Character parameter and returns a Boolean result.
- The Boolean is true if the Character passed to the predicate needs to be present in the resulting string. It's false otherwise.
- The implementation:

```kotlin
fun String.filter(predicate: (Char) -> Boolean): String {
    val sb = StringBuilder()
    for(index in 0 until length){
        val element = get(index)
        if(predicate(element)) sb.append(element)
    }
    return sb.toString()
}

>>> println("ab1c".filter{it in 'a'...'z'})
abc
```
