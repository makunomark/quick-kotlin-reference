## 8. Higher Order Functions

### Lambdas as parameters and return values.

What we will cover:

- [Function types](/function-types-8.1.md)
- Higher order functions and their use for structuring code
- Inline functions
- Non-local returns and labels
- Anonymous functions

Definitions of higher order functions

- Higher Order functions are functions that take lambdas as arguments or return them. (In Kotlin's context)
- Higher order functions is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns one.(Seems language agnostic)

Benefits of higher order functions

- Remove code duplication
- Help simplify code
- Build nice abstractions

Benefits of inline functions:

- help reduce perfomance overhead associated with lambdas.
- enable flexible control flow with lambdas
