## 8.1.4 Returning functions from functions

- To declare a function that returns another function, specify a function type as the return type.
- To return a function, write a return expression followed by a lambda, a member reference, or another expression of a function type such as a local variable.

Example:

- Imagine, a piece of logic that can change depending on the state of the program (or other conditions).
- For instance, a function that calculates the cost of shipping depending on the method of shipping selected.
- We can define a function that chooses the appropriate logic and returns it as a function.
- Here is how this could look

```kotlin
enum class Delivery { STANDARD, EXPEDICTED }

class Order(val itemCount: Int)

fun getShippingCalculator(
    delivery: Delivery
): (Order) -> Double {
    if(delivery == delivery.EXPEDICTED){
        return { order -> 6 + 2.1 * order.itemCount }
    }

    return { 1.2 * order.itemCount }
}

>>> fun calculator = getShippingCalculator(
    Delivery.EXPEDICTED
)

>>> println("Shipping costs ${calculator(Order(3))}")
Shipping costs 12.3
```
